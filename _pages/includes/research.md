**Open set recognition with incremental learning**


  - Model the classification boundary using extreme value theory (EVT) to achieve open-set recognition.
    
  - Update the recognition model based on an effective exemplar selection strategy.

  - Implement the algorithm and evaluate the performance on two public satellite imagery datasets.

**Open set recognition based on a hyperspherical embedding network**



  - Model extracted features onto a unit hypersphere with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to improve the inter-class separability of learned representations.
    
  - Measure the similarity of samples to each class center by angular difference and design a discrimination criterion to detect unknown targets based on this metric.

  - Calibrate the predicted probability according to an uncertainty estimation score to output more reliable predictions.

  - Implement the algorithm and evaluate the performance on two public satellite imagery datasets (MSTAR).

**A threshold-free open-set recognition network for satellite imagery**




  - Propose a threshold-free open-set learning network for satellite target recognition.
    
  - Improve the network structure of GAN to formulate the open-set recognition problem as a K+1 classification task, allowing the model to achieve both known classes classification and unknown classes identification automatically.

  - Implement the algorithm, evaluate the performance, and compare it with four SOTA models on two public satellite datasets (MSTAR and SAMPLE).
