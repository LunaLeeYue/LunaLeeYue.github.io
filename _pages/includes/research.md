**Open set recognition based on a hyperspherical embedding network**

  - Model extracted features onto a unit hypersphere with von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to improve the inter-class separability of feature representations.
    
  - Measure the similarity of samples to each class center and design a discrimination criterion to detect unknown targets based on this metric.

  - Calibrate the predicted probability based on uncertainty estimation.

  - Implement the algorithm and evaluate the performance on two public satellite imagery datasets (MSTAR).

**A threshold-free open-set recognition network for satellite imagery**

  - Propose a threshold-free open-set learning network for satellite target recognition.
    
  - Improve the network structure of GAN to formulate the open-set recognition problem as a K+1 classification task.

  - Implement the algorithm, evaluate the performance, and compare it with four SOTA models on two public satellite datasets (MSTAR and SAMPLE).
